These datasets are described as shown below:

1. ETT (Electricity Transformer Temperature) Datasets
Description: ETT is a series of datasets, including ETTh1, ETTm1, ETTh2, and ETTm2, where "1" and "2" represent different transformers. "h" and "m" represent different sampling frequency (every 15 minute and every hour).

2. Electricity
Description: Electricity records the electricity consumption in kWh every 1 hour from 2012 to 2014. It contains 321 clients.

3. Weather
Description: Weather is recorded every 10 minutes for 2020 whole year, which contains 21 meteorological indicators, such as air temperature, humidity, etc. Kindly note that there are multiple versions of Weather dataset in different papers, such as AutoFormer and Informer. We choose the version of AutoFormer.

4. Exchange Rate
Description: The collection of the daily exchange rates of eight countries including Australia, British, Canada, Switzerland, China, Japan, New Zealand, and Singapore.

5. Beijing Air Quality
Description: The air quality index of Beijing, including seven indicators: AQI(Air quality index), PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, O3, and CO. The sampling rate is 1 hours. Missing values are filled using linear interpolation.

6. METR-LA
Description: METR-LA is a traffic speed dataset collected from loop-detectors located on the LA County road network. It contains data of 207 sensors over a period of 4 months from Mar 2012 to Jun 2012. The traffic information is recorded at the rate of every 5 minutes. METR-LA also includes a sensor graph to indicate dependencies between sensors. DCRNN computes the pairwise road network distances between sensors and build the adjacency matrix using a thresholded Gaussian kernel.

7. PEMS-BAY
Description: PEMS-BAY is a traffic speed dataset collected from California Transportation Agencies (CalTrans) Performance Measurement System (PeMS). It contains data of 325 sensors in the Bay Area over a period of 6 months from Jan 2017 to June 2017. The traffic information is recorded at the rate of every 5 minutes. PEMS-BAY also includes a sensor graph to indicate dependencies between sensors. DCRNN computes the pairwise road network distances between sensors and build the adjacency matrix using a thresholded Gaussian kernel.
